<h3>The Issue</h3>
<p>
Windows has a problem displaying certain JPEG images. This problem typically manifests as
"Windows Photo Viewer stretches my images". An example of an extreme case:
</p><p>
<IMG alt=one-pixel src="../images/win_dpi_extreme.PNG">
</p><p>
There are various threads out in the InterWebs complaining about the issue.
E.g. <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/windows7-photo-viewer-compresses-my-jpgs-to-a/10be5522-2a9b-4644-a42d-c2e5ba2e908b?page=1">here</a>
, and <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/windows-photo-viewer-stretches-my-pictures/41261f20-cf26-49cf-9843-f08f527700a2?page=1">here</a>.
Google for "Windows Photo Viewer thin line" and you'll get plenty more.
The problem is not limited to Windows' built-in utilities: it also shows up
for us image application developers. The reason is the problem is in the Windows
image libraries apon which many image applications are built.
</p><p>
For the typical user, often the problem first showed up when they upgraded from
Windows XP to a newer version of Windows. The Windows XP utility "Windows Picture and Fax Viewer"
did not show the problem. The Windows Vista and later utility, "Windows Photo Viewer",
is impacted by the problem. On Windows 10, the "Photo Gallery" app doesn't have
the problem, but the "Windows Photo Viewer" on Windows 10 <emphasis>does</emphasis>.
</p><p>
For said typical user, there are only two possible solutions:
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>View the images with a different program.
<li>Fix the images.
</ol>
</p><p>
The InterWebs threads suggest more than one possible cause for the problem.
I cannot comment regarding the validity of the "incorrect EXIF data" suggestion,
as I've not encountered any instance of said images. I <i>can</i> however confirm
that JPEG images with strange DPI encodings will confuse "Windows Photo Viewer",
and other Microsoft applications.

<h3>The JPEG Standard re DPI</h3>
<p>
On page 5 of the JPEG standard (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf">here</a>),
the header is described. Three fields are behind this problem: the Xdensity, Ydensity,
and units. Here is a screencap of the relevant details (highlighted):
</P>
<p>

</p>
<p>
For unknown reasons, some image editing applications have stored inconsistent,
or inappropriate, values in those fields. The Windows image libraries attempt to 
honor those values, usually with poor results.
</p>

<h3>Fixing Your Code</h3>
<P>
You'll never encounter the problem if you always specify the output height and
width when drawing images (or if you don't have any buggy JPEGs!). But if you
rely on <code>System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapImage</code> or <code>Graphics.DrawImage</code>
to correctly "guess" the destination size of images, the problem will occur.
By specifying the output dimensions of the image, you force the Image libraries
to ignore the DPI values <i>inside</i> the image.
</p>
<p>
Example of problematic code (<code>Graphics.DrawImage</code>):
</p>
<pre>
Bitmap imageFromFile; // image loaded from a file
Bitmap destImage;     // image being drawn to
using (Graphics gg = Graphics.FromImage(destImage))
{
	gg.DrawImage(imageFromFile, destX, destY);
}
</pre>
<p>
and a working version:
</p>
<pre>
Bitmap imageFromFile; // image loaded from a file
Bitmap destImage;     // image being drawn to
int destW = imageFromFile.Width; // desired output size
int destH = imageFromFile.Height; // desired output size
using (Graphics gg = Graphics.FromImage(destImage))
{
	gg.DrawImage(imageFromFile, destX, destY, destW, destH);
}
</pre>
<p>
Straight from the Microsoft examples, the following WPF fragments will
display problematic images badly (first the XAML version, then the 
code-behind variant):
</p>
<textarea rows="6" cols="112">
<Image Width="200">
  <Image.Source>
    <BitmapImage DecodePixelWidth="200"  
     UriSource="C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\My Pictures\Sample Pictures\Water Lilies.jpg" />
  </Image.Source>
</Image>
</textarea>
<p> </p>
<pre>
Image myImage = new Image();
myImage.Width = 200;

// Create source
BitmapImage myBitmapImage = new BitmapImage();

// BitmapImage.UriSource must be in a BeginInit/EndInit block
myBitmapImage.BeginInit();
myBitmapImage.UriSource = new Uri(@"C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\My Pictures\Sample Pictures\Water Lilies.jpg");
myBitmapImage.DecodePixelWidth = 200;
myBitmapImage.EndInit();
//set image source
myImage.Source = myBitmapImage;
</pre>
<p>
N.B. specifying the <code>DecodePixelWidth</code> value does <strong>not</strong>
solve the problem. 
</p><p>
An example of fixed code for WPF is too long to show here. In my projects, I'm using an
<code>ImageConverter</code>, and in that code, performing convolutions to specify the image dimensions.
See the <code>BooruTagger</code> repository, <code>ImageConverter.cs</code>.
</p>


<h3>Identifying Problem Images</h3>
<p>
In my testing, I have found the following scenarios:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>units = 0</td>
<td>No issues</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>units = 1; Xdensity or Ydensity is zero</td>
<td>No issues</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>units = 1; Xdensity or Ydensity is 1</td>
<td>Displays as a very narrow image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>units = 1; Xdensity != Ydensity</td>
<td>Displays stretched or distorted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>units = 1; Xdensity == Ydensity, value is > 100</td>
<td>May display tiny (image DPI is > screen DPI of 96)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Annoyingly, various tools which might easily identify an image's DPI settings,
do a poor job. Specifically, Windows Explorer never shows the two values,
only the one "valid" value. The <code>identify</code> program (part of ImageMagick)
also fails to provide useful data, even in <code>-verbose</code> mode.
</p><p>
So I wrote my own. The code below is the guts of the "is this a problem image" test:
</p>
<pre>
const int READ_SIZE = 32;
byte[] bom = new byte[READ_SIZE];

using (FileStream fileStream = File.OpenRead(afile))
{
	fileStream.Read(bom, 0, READ_SIZE);
	for (int i = 0; i < READ_SIZE - 4; i++)
	{
		// search for 'JFIF' signature
		if (bom[i] != 'J' || bom[i + 1] != 'F' || 
		    bom[i + 2] != 'I' || bom[i + 3] != 'F') 
			continue;

		// found it.
		int units = bom[i + 7];
		int xd = bom[i + 8] * 256 + bom[i + 9];
		int yd = bom[i + 10] * 256 + bom[i + 11];
		if (units == 0) // zero for units appears not to be a problem
			break; // don't search any further
		if (xd != yd)
		{
			if (xd == 1 || yd == 1)
				Console.WriteLine("Thin image: {0} ({3}:{1}x{2})", afile, xd, yd, units);
			else if (yd != 0) // zero for ydensity appears not to be a problem
				Console.WriteLine("Stretch image: {0} ({3}:{1}x{2})", afile, xd, yd, units);
		}

		break; // don't look any further [at least one image with two JFIF signatures...]
	}
</pre>
<p>
For the rest of the code, see my <b>JFIF_Scanner</b> repository. It doesn't identify
images where the DPI is way out of whack compared to the screen DPI of 96.
</p>
<p>How many 'problem' images did I have? 637 "thin" images (width of 1 pixel)
and 407 "stretched" images - X and Y DPI values out of sync. Out of ... 473,000+
jpeg files.
