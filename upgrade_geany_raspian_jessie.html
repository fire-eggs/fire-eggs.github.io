I wanted to upgrade the Geany editor on my Raspberry Pi. I am
currently running Raspian Jessie, and the installed Geany is 
at V1.24. At this time, the latest Geany is at V1.33.</P>

<p>My attempt to add the geany-dev repository for apt failed. So
I investigated upgrading Geany from source. Alas, the Geany 
source upgrade instructions are a little opaque: they assume 
their requirements are already installed, and don't explain the
detailed steps required to satisfy their requirements. See
<a href="https://www.geany.org/manual/index.html#installation">here</a>.
</p>

<p>With some searching and digging, plus a couple of failed
install attempts, I was able to determine the following
packages needed to be installed for the Geany install:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev intltool
</pre>

<p>The first two are required to build the Geany source; the
last for the Geany install.</p>

<p>Once the above packages are in place, this is the set of
shell commands I used successfully to build and install
Geany V1.33:</p>

<pre>
cd /tmp
wget https://download.geany.org/geany-1.33.tar.gz
tar xvf geany-1.33.tar.gz
cd geany-1.33
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>

<p>Now the Raspian menu entry for Geany invokes Geany V1.33!</p>
